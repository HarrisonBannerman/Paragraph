Alongside this letter I have attached the most recent copies of both my resume and unofficial transcript to apply as a Wildlife Information & Data Intern I found posted on hbcui.gyfoundation.org. Being a junior STEM major at Morehouse College, I have not yet been given the opportunity to test my technical skills in a fast paced work environment. After reviewing the duties and requirements of the position, I have to admit I am incredibly excited just to be applying for this program. While I do not have an extensive background in data mining, I believe I am a proficient programmer who loves being faced with a challenge and is always looking for opportunities to better both myself and my work experience.
I have full confidence in my abilities if I were to be selected as an intern. Whenever I am assigned an important task or project, I truly enjoy creating a day to day work plan to complete it to the best of my abilities in a timely manner. I would be ecstatic to have the chance to apply my skills in this internship, and this is especially true because I will have the chance to visit a new city and work with those who have experience in the same field I would love to pursue.
